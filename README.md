### Bugs <a name = "bugs"></a>

<b>These are very big bug I found, some have proper solutions, some don't</b>

- [x] Firebase can't not custom feature forgot password
- Problem: Firebase lack of function
- Solution: Store auth data in firestore
- - Write rule for admin can edit, and owner only update
- - Idea quiet not security but temporarily sovle

- [x] Tab view quite lag
- - Problem: Tab alway rebuild
- - Solution: use "AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin"

- [x] Popup not access bloc from previous context
- - Problem: Mostly popup use variable "useRootNavigator = true", becauce popup pushed in route
- - Problem: builder function (context) ..., this context is new not context previous
- - Solution: "useRootNavigator = false" and "(context)" -> "(_)"
- - Solution: I dont fully undertand becauce this solution temporary

- [ ] Mutil navigator can error duplication key
- - Problem: No idea!
- - Solution: No Idea!

## Some thing i had<a name = "created"></a>

### Firebase Schema<a name = "schema"></a>

----------

### These Rules for firestore i'm proud of<a name = "rule"></a>

- - Rule setting only user authenticated see private info
- - Only members in participants field can view data

[**Rules Link.**](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/icon-af204.appspot.com/o/rule_aking.png?alt=media&token=62f5eeca-70ed-48a4-a860-0a9aff29febd)<br>


## Some Note<a name = "note"></a>

### Username only can email

Because lack of function for authentication and only email auth can custom otp

Firebase support phone, button login need otp, and UI need password, so i only use email auth

Use phone quite inconvenience, and UI for username password more beautiful

### Show Dialog

Show Dialog mostly navigator.push(context, useRootNavigator)

Because Provider and Bloc inheritance from context, and usually they dont placed at root navigator

So you should useRootNavigator = false, and (context) into (_) to use bloc from previous route

But it's not entirely correct, there are still exceptions
